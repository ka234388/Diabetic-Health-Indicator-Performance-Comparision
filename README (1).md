# Diabetic Health Indicator System (CAP6545 Final Project)

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting diabetes status (Non-Diabetic, Pre-Diabetic, Diabetic) using structured health data from the BRFSS 2015 dataset. The project implements and compares three deep learning models:

- Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)
- TabTransformer
- Deep Neural Decision Forest (DNDF)

## üìÅ Dataset

- Source: [BRFSS 2015 Health Indicators Dataset](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/)
- Preprocessing:
  - Train-test split
  - Class balancing using SMOTE
  - Standardization using StandardScaler

---

## üß† Models Implemented

### 1. MLP (Multi-layer Perceptron)
- Built using PyTorch
- Four hidden layers with ReLU and Dropout
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss: CrossEntropyLoss with class weights
- Learning rate scheduler: ReduceLROnPlateau

### 2. TabTransformer
- Attention-based model built using PyTorch
- Embedding + Transformer Encoder + Classifier
- Label smoothing applied
- Optimizer: AdamW
- Dropout and weight decay for regularization

### 3. DNDF (Deep Neural Decision Forest)
- Implemented using TensorFlow/Keras
- Dense layers with LeakyReLU
- Softmax trees averaged as ensemble layer
- Optimizer: Adam
- Regularized with Dropout and EarlyStopping
